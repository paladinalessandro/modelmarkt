ModelMarkt Project Structure (Hackathon Edition)
🚀 Project Description

A lightweight marketplace for fast classification APIs. Users can upload pretrained vision models (e.g., fruit-freshness classifier, dog detector, etc.), test them in an interactive playground, and generate API keys to call them programmatically.

The project is intentionally built for a hackathon using two fully decoupled repositories:

Frontend repo — UI, authentication, playground

Backend repo — API services, file-based storage

They are deployed, versioned, and developed independently.

ModelMarkt Project Structure (Hackathon Edition)

This document describes the architecture, folder structure, API contract, and conventions for ModelMarkt.
It is optimized for a fast hackathon build with separate frontend and backend repositories that communicate only via HTTP.

🏗️ High-Level Architecture

Frontend (Next.js or SvelteKit — separate repository)
Communicates only with the backend via process.env.BACKEND_URL.

Backend (Node + Express or FastAPI — separate repository)
Stateless. No real database — just JSON files and model files inside the /models folder.

Storage (local filesystem inside the backend repo)

/models/models.json → List of models and metadata

/models/<id>.keras → The saved model

/models/<id>.json → Optional model metadata

/apikeys.json → Stored API keys mapped to StackAuth user IDs

🔌 Backend API Contract
GET /models

Returns the list of available models.

{
  models: [
    {
      id: "123",
      name: "Object Detector",
      description: "Detects items from…",
      createdAt: "2025-01-01"
    }
  ]
}

POST /model/:id

Runs inference for a model.

Body:

file (multipart)

optional JSON params

POST /upload

Uploads a new trained model.

Flow:

Save model and metadata in /models/

Update models.json

POST /apikey/create

Request body:

{
  "stackauthUserId": "string"
}


Response:

{
  apiKey: "generated-key-abc123"
}


Stored in apikeys.json.

GET /apikey/get?userId=XXX

Returns an existing API key.

{
  apiKey: "abc123"
}

👤 User Profile Requirements (Frontend Only)

Stored only in the frontend via StackAuth:

Name

Email

Profile picture

API key generation button

Backend stores only API keys.

🎛️ Model Playground UI (Frontend)

For each model page:

File upload

Optional parameters

Run Model → POST to backend

Output viewer

🚫 Billing

🔧 Environment Variables

Frontend config:

BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3001"


Backend has no env vars (hackathon mode).
